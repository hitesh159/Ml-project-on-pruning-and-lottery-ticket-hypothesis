# Ml-project-on-pruning-and-lottery-ticket-hypothesis
The file **ml_project_mnist.ipynb** contains all the experiments and results of MNIST dataset.<br />
The file **ml_project_fashionmnist.ipynb** contains all the experiments and results of FashionMNIST dataset.<br />
The rest of the files are just saved models that were saved after training and used for pruning.<br />
**model2** was saved baseline model for MNIST , and **model1_fas** was the saved baseline model for FashionMNIST.<br />
**lotteryinit** and **fashion_lotteryinit** contains saved initalizations for MNIST and FashionMNIST respectively for applying lottery ticket based method.<br />
**lotterytrain** and **fashion_lotterytrain** contains trained weights which gain max validation accuracy for MNIST and FashionMNIST respectively for applying lottery ticket based method.<br />
